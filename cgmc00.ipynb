    "A program, when enhanced with artificial intelligence and capable of responding to a human being, by generating responses to text input from a computer in a conversational manner.  Such a program is known chat bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT is a special class of chat bots that have been trained on a very large body of text, typically above 50GB and and into the terabytes of data.  These type training models are known as large language models (LLMs).  The acronym GPT is translates as Generative Pre-trained Transformers and this gives an indication into the technology behind chat GPT.  Chat GPT uses a classic supervised training regime where the model uses the large body of text as examples of how to predict the next word based on the previous text.  In addition, it uses a special class of neural networks known as Transformers to maintain semantic information across very long sequence lengths, this is why chat GPT always produces results with consistently correct grammar.  In other words, the language model does not only track word sequences but also the logical meaning of the sentences and paragraphs it processes, so that when it generates it own text it is logically consistent with human understanding of the grammar used."

    "## Lesson 2 - Basic prompting principles and techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to lesson 2.  In lesson one, we left off outlining a list of projects which we will be using Chat GPT to implement.  We start with a simple financial double-entry system.  Then, we shall a detour into the mechanics of GPT and return back into the world of finance to implement a more advanced financial application - an investment bot.  but why take the detour?  Well, in this master class, we will be comparing 3 different ways of using ChatGPT.  The first is the simple way, this is, without prompt engineering, let us call this the brute force method. We would in this master class use practical projects to discover why prompt engineering is essential and how it makes us accomplish more, than without prompt engineering.  So the use of prompt engineering will be the second method at the heart of this class, but we won't stop there!  In this class, I will go the extra mile to use advanced methods which are of interest to the researcher.  This will be the ultimate test for the prompt engineering method.  By comparing large language model prompt engineering techniques to more traditional artificial intelligence research methods, we will be able to characterise ChatGPT mechanics and better understand if, why, and how prompt engineering gives the results it does.  It is important to note that at all times, chatGPT would still be utilised in all of the methods at the micro-level and we will be applying prompt engineering skills at various levels to all the tasks.   Also note that although I will take great pains to oversimplify the advanced methods, I will also keep it as much as I can, academically engaging such that a researcher can repeat the experiments on their own.  Moreover, the advanced methods will NOT be required to understand the rest of the materials in this class and can be skipped altogether by those who are only interested in the main focus of the master class, which is prompt engineering.  For such individuals, you will only be interested in the names of the methods, the resulting outcomes, and how they stacked up against prompt engineering methods and chatGPT's artificial and arguably sparks of \"_general_\" intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this class is designed to be hands-on, the main techniques in prompt engineering will first be outlined and explained in this lesson.  In the next lesson, we shall dive into our first project to apply the principles learned in this lesson.  Let's get started!  So what are the main techniques in prompt engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Prompt engineering principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ChatGPT itself surmises, to guide a model toward the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.  This in a nutshell sums up prompt engineering.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to expand on this.  I shall first of all use my own analysis of the above assertion, and then, use the above definition to illustrate how one can apply the principle to perform text inference using ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the summary given by ChatGPT has two principles in one\n",
    "1. Clear and concise instruction\n",
    "2. Apply context narrowing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see later, there is the third principle of iteration. This is done to refine ChatGPT results.  Nevertheless, these two principles appear to be in conflict with each other, and rightly so.  To get the best out of ChatGPT, one needs the right mixture of both conciseness as well as giving context.  This, in summary, means that while using chat GPT, you would need to give as much information as possible about your objective, and this information should be as specific as possible. Let us call this prompt engineering technique context specification. Another way to describe context specification is by saying that while requesting information from chat GPT it would be beneficial to narrow the information or context to as many anchors as possible which will guide the response to the specific response and results you desire. Techniques of context specification or context narrowing include \n",
    "1. Using text boundaries to avoid text injection\n",
    "2. Asking chat GPT to role play\n",
    "3. Identifying the prompt response target audience\n",
    "4. Specifying the length of the response\n",
    "5. Using response formatters\n",
    "6. Applying types of responses to prompts (see section 1.2 in lesson 1)\n",
    "7. Using the above techniques to ask chat GPT to refine your prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in the summary of lesson 1, we used techniques 3 and 6 to narrow the context of the prompt.  That is, we asked chat GPT to summarise (technique 6 - using the summarise use-case) the text for a 5 year old (technique 3 - identifying a target audience).  We shall learn more about these techniques throughout this class, but first, let us ask chatGPT to provide us with what it thinks the principles of prompt engineering techniques are.  In this prompt, we will apply some of the techniques outlined above to specify context.   Here is the prompt:\n",

    "### 2.2 Summary\n",

    "1. Be clear and specific\n",
    "\n",
    "\tClear and specific instructions provide a structure for the model to follow, which helps to reduce irrelevant or incorrect responses. It is important to define the task and the expected output as specifically as possible so that the model can accurately interpret what is being asked of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Provide context\n",
    "\n",
    "\tContext is important in helping models understand the nuances of language and the meaning behind the words. Longer prompts with more context can provide a more complete understanding of the task at hand, improving the model's ability to generate accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid ambiguity \n",
    "\n",
    "\tAmbiguity in prompts can lead to confusion and incorrect responses from the model. It is important to use precise language and avoid idioms or phrases that could be interpreted in multiple ways. Additionally, providing examples and clarifying any potential misunderstandings can help prevent ambiguity in prompts.\n",

So, in this lesson, demonstrate the method of iteration of improving the output of a prompt.  This is by using different prompts successively.  One could achieve this by using a different prompt altogether while another strategy would be by providing further context and yet another strategy would be by further narrowing down the initial prompt to ask chat GPT provide further details on the previous prompt response.  In the prompt below we use the first strategy by asking it to approach the question in a different way by providing good and bad examples.  Here is the prompt.\n",

    "Corrected Prompt: \"Write a paragraph about your day yesterday, including at least three specific activities you did\"\n",

    "Wrong Prompt: \"Explain how to use a hammer\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrected Prompt: \"Write a step-by-step guide on how to use a hammer to hang a picture frame\"\n",

    "### The Ledger Manager program\n",
    "In this lesson, we promised to use Chat GPT to implement an expense manager.   So in this lesson, we begin the first part of that program which is a ledger manager program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people describe chat GPT as a very knowledgeable 10 year old.  While initially, I was really impressed with Chat GPT's capabilities.  I tend to agree that though quite knowledgeable, Chat GPT still requires guidance and doesn't always gives exactly correct answers.  As such, when prompt engineers refer to the use of iteration as a method to refine Chat GPT's responses, this can be likened to when a child is guided to the correct answer when interacting with them on a problem.  With Chat GPT, especially in this context of being used for programming, some users describe Chat GPT as a junior developer, where it can write correct programs but does not always take into consideration the pragmatics and architectural patterns a senior developer may consider when working on a problem.   I certainly found this to be the case.  In the first instance, the quickest limitation on ChatGPT3+ is the amount of tokens it can process and produce.  So while, chat GPT can write some programs it is worth bearing in mind that it  may not be able to complete an entire project.  So it bears upon the engineer to design how ChatGPT assists with program writing.  For me as an aspiring solution architect, I am especially enjoying using Chat GPT to test drive the process of breaking down a solution to manageable chunks for more Junior developers which is the role of Chat GPT to engineer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How have I done this?  For the expense manager, I have started with the core engine which is the Ledger manager.  Having done some requirements engineering, I have decided to break down the Expense manager program by working on a core accounting book keeping program called a ledger manager.  Normally for this type of decisions, I would not consult ChatGPT as these architectural decisions may not be within the reach of ChatGPT's non-contextual reasoning.  To justify the hypothesis, I did a series of prompts to which I got some initial useful inputs, but could not get ChatGPT to decipher the more nuanced ideas behind the expert manager solution.  To this end I utilised chat GPT as more or less a a junior developer helping to simulate my ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could not get ChatGPT to come up with a solution for an expense manager that I could work with.  This was because, it could only generate information about the final goal which was the expense manager.  Nevertheless, I wanted to use the ledger manager as a basis of any accounting solution which would also include an expense manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the analysis of the ledger manager.  In the most accepted method of solving the accounting problem, the double entry system, the ledger consists of two accounts, one being debited, while the other being credited.  The simplest way to achieve this is using a ledger entry that consists of the debited account, the credited account, the amount and the date of the transaction.  Each account will be categorised according to the type to which they belong to which will also satisfy financial accounting rules and reporting.  This categorisation is typically technically known as the chart of accounts.\n",

    "As you can see this is a lot of code, which is quite impressive for chat GPT.  Does this code work.  Spoiler alert - it doesn't quite compile.   But let's go through the prompt first.  I was planning to do a QML application and not a QT application.  However, I wanted to keep things simple and to no surprise, I askded for and it produced a QT application using QT widgets and not QML.  In addition, I asked it what QT modules to include in the program adding the QtSQL module. Adding the QtSQL adds further emphases to the fact that I required the response to perform create, read, update and delete operations.  I could also predict that it would produce a fairly accurate response based on the fact that CRUD operation with SQL would likely have abundant examples on the internet which the Chat GPT model is based upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important nuanced aspect of the problem which I did not expect chat GPT to figure out was the exact model-view pattern to follow.  There are several approaches to this and each approach would modify the code significantly.  This is probably one of the reasons why the code did not compile.  Once again to emphasise the nature of Chat GPT is to guide it to the correct solution, therefore, prompt iteration would probably by default become a part of any advanced Chat GPT workflow.  It is therefore the best practice to guide Chat GPT to the correct response.  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that asking chat GPT to correct compilation error will guarantee it to produce the correct answer.  In this particular case some programming experience with C++ nuances was  required to get the program to compile.  In this instance, it was related to using copy constructors and the assignment operator which chatGPT provided implementations for with some post response corrections related to not having the previous context or not interpreting it correctly.  Here is the program when it finally ran.\n",

    "Not too bad.  Although the program was logically ill-functioning. The only thing that worked was the ability to view and add records.  Even the records being added had additional sporadic data being inserted in addition to the expected row.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with the reduced performance of the application it has served two important functions.  It has provided boiler plate code to build on, a user interface to work with.  This two as provided one of the most important tools in the software industry a rapid prototype.  Note that this rapid prototype was quite intentional.  You may have observed that the prompt did not ask chat GPT to build the entire model but only one of the entities, that is, the ledger entity.  This was intentional.  The ledger entity captures the transactional component of the design and forms the central entity of all the other entities.  It is always strategic in software rapid prototyping to start from the core and build around the core in short iterations.  Note that short iterations in rapid prototyping is a different concept from iterating in prompt engineering.  Nevertheless they seem to work well together so why not?\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's class we have used prompt engineering iterations to refine the prompt response.  We have seen different strategies to iterations that include framing the original prompt in a different way or providing more focused additional prompt based on the previous prompts in a conversational style chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson we will look more into iteration or conversational-style prompts and also look at some advanced methods and see how they stack up against regular prompt engineering which is the focus of this class.  We will build upon the ledger class and see if we can use chat GPT to make the program work as it should and expand upon the core program.  See you then!\n"
