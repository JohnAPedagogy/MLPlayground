    "### 1.1 What is Chat GPT?\n",
    "A program, when enhanced with artificial intelligence and capable of responding to a human being, by generating responses to text input from a computer in a conversational manner.  Such a program is known chat bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT is a special class of chat bots that have been trained on a very large body of text, typically above 50GB and and into the terabytes of data.  These type training models are known as large language models (LLMs).  The acronym GPT is translates as Generative Pre-trained Transformers and this gives an indication into the technology behind chat GPT.  Chat GPT uses a classic supervised training regime where the model uses the large body of text as examples of how to predict the next word based on the previous text.  In addition it uses a special class of neural networks known as Transformers to maintain semantic information across sequence lengths.  In summary the language model does not only tracks word sequences but also the logical meaning of the sentences and paragraphs it processes, so that when it generates it own text it is logically consistent with human understanding of the grammar used."

    "Hi there! In this class, we will learn about something called Chat GPT. It's like a robot that can talk to people using a computer! This robot has been trained to understand words and sentences in a special way so it can answer questions and even help with making computer programs. We will use it to help us build a new business. Isn't that cool? Let's get started!  This summary was generated by chat GPT when asked to rephrase the above sections for a 5 year old.  I hope you found it useful!"

    "## Lesson 2 - Basic prompting principles and techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to lesson 2.  In lesson one, we left off outlining a list of projects which we will be using Chat GPT to implement.  We start with a simple financial double-entry system.  Then, we shall a detour into the mechanics of GPT and return back into the world of finance to implement a more advanced financial application - an investment bot.  but why take the detour?  Well, in this master class, we will be comparing 3 different ways of using ChatGPT.  The first is the simple way, this is, without prompt engineering, let us call this the brute force method. We would in this master class use practical projects to discover why prompt engineering is essential and how it makes us accomplish more, than without prompt engineering.  So the use of prompt engineering will be the second method at the heart of this class, but we won't stop there!  In this class, I will go the extra mile to use advanced methods which are of interest to the researcher.  This will be the ultimate test for the prompt engineering method.  By comparing large language model prompt engineering techniques to more traditional artificial intelligence research methods, we will be able to characterise ChatGPT mechanics and better understand if, why, and how prompt engineering gives the results it does.  It is important to note that at all times, chatGPT would still be utilised in all of the methods at the micro-level and we will be applying prompt engineering skills at various levels to all the tasks.   Also note that although I will take great pains to oversimplify the advanced methods, I will also keep it as much as I can, academically engaging such that a researcher can repeat the experiments on their own.  Moreover, the advanced methods will NOT be required to understand the rest of the materials in this class and can be skipped altogether by those who are only interested in the main focus of the master class, which is prompt engineering.  For such individuals, you will only be interested in the names of the methods, the resulting outcomes, and how they stacked up against prompt engineering methods and chatGPT's artificial and arguably sparks of \"_general_\" intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this class is designed to be hands-on, the main techniques in prompt engineering will first be outlined and explained in this lesson.  In the next lesson, we shall dive into our first project to apply the principles learned in this lesson.  Let's get started!  So what are the main techniques in prompt engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Prompt engineering principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As ChatGPT itself surmises, to guide a model toward the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context.  This in a nutshell sums up prompt engineering.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to expand on this.  I shall first of all use my own analysis of the above assertion, and then, use the above definition to illustrate how one can apply the principle to perform text inference using ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the summary given by ChatGPT has two principles in one\n",
    "1. Clear and concise instruction\n",
    "2. Apply context\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see later, there is the third principle of iteration. This is done to refine ChatGPT results.  Nevertheless, these two principles appear to be in conflict with each other, and rightly so.  To get the best out of ChatGPT, one needs the right mixture of both conciseness as well as giving context.  This, in summary, means that while using chat GPT, you would need to give as much information as possible about the objective and this information should be as specific as possible. Let us call this prompt engineering technique context specification. Another way to describe context specification is by saying that while requesting information from chat GPT it would be beneficial to narrow the information or context to as many anchors as possible which will guide the response to the specific answer and results that you desire. Techniques of context narrowing include \n",
    "1. Using text boundaries to avoid text injection\n",
    "2. Asking chat GPT to role play\n",
    "3. Identifying the target audience\n",
    "4. Specifying the length of the response\n",
    "5. Using response formatters\n",
    "6. Applying types of responses to prompts (see section 1.2 in lesson 1)\n",
    "7. Using the above techniques to ask chat GPT to refine your prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "While we shall learn more about these techniques throughout this class, let us first ask chatGPT to provide us with what it thinks the principles of prompt engineering techniques are.  In this prompt, we will apply some of the techniques outlined above to specify context.   Here is the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "given text in the 'text' tag, Expand on this by providing three bullet point principles of prompt engineering and explaining why these principles are most effective. Here is the text.`<text>` to guide a model towards the desired output and reduce the chances of irrelevant or incorrect responses, it is important to provide clear and specific instructions, which may require longer prompts for more clarity and context `</text>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Summary\n",
    "Here are the three bullet point principles of prompt engineering and why they are effective:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be clear and specific\n",
    "\tClear and specific instructions provide a structure for the model to follow, which helps to reduce irrelevant or incorrect responses. It is important to define the task and the expected output as specifically as possible so that the model can accurately interpret what is being asked of it\n",
    "2. Provide context\n",
    "\tContext is important in helping models understand the nuances of language and the meaning behind the words. Longer prompts with more context can provide a more complete understanding of the task at hand, improving the model's ability to generate accurate responses.\n",
    "3. Avoid ambiguity \n",
    "\tAmbiguity in prompts can lead to confusion and incorrect responses from the model. It is important to use precise language and avoid idioms or phrases that could be interpreted in multiple ways. Additionally, providing examples and clarifying any potential misunderstandings can help prevent ambiguity in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the seven techniques outlined above which techniques were used to produce the above prompt? In what way can this prompt be improved?"
